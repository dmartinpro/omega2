Tips and tricks
---------------

If the console seems broken, displaying a list of files (something like: "Index of /console/") instead of the nice UI, use this direct URL:
http://192.168.3.1/setup-wizard/

If you were previously connected to the console you may be unable to follow the webflow... Use another browser in this situation.
