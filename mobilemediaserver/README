How to use the script
---------------------

Connect to Omega2:

    ssh root@wherever.it.is

(default password is 'onioneer')

Download the script:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmartinpro/omega2/master/mobilemediaserver/setup.sh

And execute it:

    chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh


Or, with a single command:

    ssh -t root@wherever.it.is 'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmartinpro/omega2/master/mobilemediaserver/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh'

Tips and tricks
---------------

If the console seems broken, displaying a list of files (something like: "Index of /console/") instead of the nice UI, use this direct URL:
http://192.168.3.1/setup-wizard/

If you were previously connected to the console you may be unable to follow the webflow... Use another browser in this situation.
